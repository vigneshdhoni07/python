a Function calling itself is recursion and when a huge problem depends on small problems we will use recursion
eg:factorial of a number

maximum recursion depth is defined and if we exceed we will get error if we dont use base case.

recursion is based on PMI(principle of mathematical induction)

base case is the first step of PMI.

recursion depth:
  even if base case is specified you may have recursion error if it reaches recursion depth.
  we can set recursion limit to avoid it.
  it can be set using sys library
